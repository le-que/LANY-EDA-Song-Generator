I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody help, it's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time? Yeah

Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
Get this out my head, so
I drive, chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget

In the heat of the moment
You think that we're broken

[Pre-Chorus]
I could see my whole life with you baby
Now you got me thinking that I'm crazy
'Cause you're

[Chorus]
Out the door, just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more
But was it really love if you can leave me for
Something so innocent?
Is this the end?
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
(Oh-ooh, oh-ooh)

[Verse]
Can't sleep, can't eat
My mind's a mess
What are you thinking?
You were happy last weekend
All the good times
How'd you forget?
I was your best friend, yeah
Remember when you said

[Pre-Chorus]
You could see your whole life with me baby
Now you got me thinking that I'm crazy
'Cause you're

[Chorus]
Out the door, just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more
But was it really love if you can leave me for
Something so innocent?
Is this the end?
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin (Oh-ooh)
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin (Oh-ooh)
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin (Oh-ooh)
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin (Oh-ooh)

[Bridge]
Said you'd be there for me through everything
Said that you'd have my back with anything
Said you'd be there for me through everything
Said that you'd have my back with anything

[Chorus]
Now you're out the door, just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more (Love no more)
But was it really love if you can leave me for (Leave me for)
Something so innocent?
Is this the end? (Is this the end?)
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin (Oh-ooh)
Out the door, just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more (Oh-ooh)
But was it really love if you can leave me for (Oh-ooh)
Something so innocent?
Is this the end? (Oh-ooh)
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin (Oh-ooh)
